Nim implementation of the [Preserves data language](https://preserves.gitlab.io/preserves/preserves.html).

## Utilities
* preserves_schema_nim
* preserves_encode
* preserves_decode
* preserves_from_json
* preserves_to_json

## Installation
`preserves_encode` is a multi-call binary that implements `preserves_encode`,
`preserves_decode`, `preserves_from_json`, and `preserves_to_json`, so the
appropriate symlinks should be created during packaging.
